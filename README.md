# Cryptocurrency Trend Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of cryptocurrency market data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It covers data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization to uncover trends and insights in the cryptocurrency market.

## Features

- Load and explore cryptocurrency datasets
- Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, convert formats)
- Analyze market capitalization, supply, and price changes
- Visualize data with bar plots, histograms, violin plots, and heatmaps
- Identify top cryptocurrencies by market cap

## Project Structure

├── Cryptocurrency trend analysis dataset.ipynb
├── CryptocurrencyData.csv
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md

## Usage

1. Place your dataset file as `CryptocurrencyData.csv` in the project directory.
2. Open `Cryptocurrency trend analysis dataset.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to:
   - Import libraries
   - Load and clean the data
   - Preprocess columns (market cap, supply, percentages)
   - Visualize trends and correlations

## Example Visualizations

- **Bar Plot:** Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap
- **Histogram:** Distribution of market caps
- **Violin Plot:** 24h price change distribution
- **Heatmap:** Correlation between numerical features
